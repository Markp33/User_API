# User_API

this is a API made by me, i have searched online for the best ways to make this. I have used node.js, express and mysql for the database.
this project costs me 5 hours to make.

to run the json file you will have to install insomnia, and run through localhost.

This right now is only the api back end i will also make a crud for this on this same reposotory 08/10/2024 15:43
I will also make a website where to data will show.
